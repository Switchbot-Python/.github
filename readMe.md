### Custom Switchbot Python Home assistant Integration 
This is an organization for managing the Custom Switchbot integration for Home asssitant. Just in case the original developer is no longer avaliable, this becomes easier to manage projects.

The only thing this is currently aimed to do is to base the HA's implemenation on the [official Python API by the Switchbot Manufacturer](https://github.com/OpenWonderLabs/python-host).
## What this is not

1. This is not the official repo for switchbot API. [That would be here](https://github.com/OpenWonderLabs)
2. Not the home to current HA's Switcbot component, [That would be here](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/switchbot)
3. Not the Organization for repos for [project on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/PySwitchbot/). The repo for the same [is here](https://github.com/Danielhiversen/pySwitchbot)
